                  <p class="card-text">
                    Neurodiversity is the acknowledgment that neurological
                    differences, such as autism, ADHD, Tourette's, dyslexia, and
                    dyspraxia, are natural variations of the human brain. Each
                    neurodivergent mind comes with its own set of strengths and
                    attributes that contribute to the diversity of human
                    experience.

                      with autism often exhibit heightened attention to detail,
                      strong pattern recognition, and intense focus. These

                      Post Traumatic Slave Syndrome has shed light on the
                      intergenerational impact of slavery and oppression. It's
                      crucial to recognize that trauma may be deeply ingrained,
                      often unconsciously affecting individuals, families and

                      Recognizing and dismantling systemic issues also involves
                      understanding the complexities of privilege. Dr. Robin
                      DiAngel's work on White Fragility highlights the
                      challenges that the white community may face in
                      acknowledging and addressing their unconscious biases. My
                      goal is not to place blame but to foster understanding,
                      growth, and allyship. As a black male psychotherapist I am
                      a most definitely a minority and therefore know 1st hand
                      what it is like to have a therapist who is not black and
                      therefore unable to acknowledge, work though and assist my

                      I therefore can not say I am the best person to work with
                      White Europeans who want to look at their unconscious bias
                      but I will be open to attempting to assist because the

                      that race and racism hurts us ALL. I am prepared to be an

                      identity and what comes with being white.

                      For those in the white community, acknowledging and

                      becoming effective allies. It involves actively listening,
                      educating oneself, and committing to challenging the
                      structures that perpetuate inequality. I will provide a

                      If you're ready to embark on a journey of self-discovery,
                      healing, and building allyship, I invite you to get in
                      touch. Together, we can create a space where healing is
                      not only individual but extends to the broader community.

                      Being a part of the LGBTQ community comes with its own set
                      of challenges. From the struggles of self-discovery and

                      orientation and gender identity in a heteronormative

                      It's essential to recognize the disparities that persist
                      within the LGBTQ community. Disturbingly, LGBTQ youth face
                      higher rates of homelessness and suicide compared to their
                      non-LGBTQ peers. This reality underscores the need for
                      compassionate and tailored therapeutic support. I not only
                      acknowledge these disparities and work together to foster
                      resilience, healing, and empowerment, I have experienced
                      some of these struggles myself. I am therefore committed
                      to help anyone on that journey of confusion, rejection and
                      isolation feel understood, heard and begin to heal with
                      love and acceptance.

                          abuse, neglect, or household dysfunction. These

                          overall well-being. Even a single ACE in childhood has

                          breaking free from the chains of early adversity and
                          creating a future defined by resilience and

                My Experience, Skills and Qualifications
              </p>
              <p>
                I bring to my practice over 20 years of experience supporting
                vulnerable clients in various settings, including the charity
                sector, national health service, housing, and mental health. My
                diverse background has allowed me to work with a wide range of
                individuals, including those involved in the criminal justice
                system, the homeless population, and those struggling with
                substance abuse and dual diagnosis. These experiences have honed
                my ability to work sensitively and effectively with clients from
                all backgrounds and with a variety of challenges and
                vulnerabilities.
              </p>
              <p>
                In addition to my practical experience, I hold a Post Graduate
                Integrative Psychotherapy Diploma accredited by the BACP. This
                multidisciplinary approach informs my work and allows me to
                tailor my interventions to the unique needs and circumstances of
                each client. My commitment to ongoing learning and professional
                development ensures that I stay current with the latest research
                and best practices in the field, further enhancing my ability to
                provide high-quality, evidence-based care.
